# PHP-Based AI Chatbot

Welcome to the **PHP-Based-AI-Chatbot** repository! This project is designed to help you create a simple chatbot using PHP, inspired by the repository [AI-CHATBOT-Wordpress](https://github.com/hassancs91/AI-CHATBOT-Wordpress) by hassancs91, with some customizations to better suit specific needs.

## Overview

This repository contains the necessary files to integrate a basic AI chatbot powered by OpenAI into your web projects. It includes both the front-end and back-end components to get your chatbot up and running.

### Files Included:

1. **`AI Chatbot.html` (Frontend)**
   - This file contains the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript necessary to display the chatbot on your webpage. Simply open it in any browser to view and interact with the chatbot interface.

2. **`Config.php` (Backend)**
   - The `Config.php` file handles the backend functionality by connecting to the OpenAI API. This file stores the history of the last chat session (which can be customized) and contains configuration settings for the OpenAI system role.
   - You can use this file to set up your OpenAI API connection and customize the chat session parameters to fit your needs.

## Future Improvements

In the future, there may be additional features, including the implementation of **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** to help the chatbot reference the most up-to-date and relevant data. This could also contribute to reducing token usage and optimizing costs.

## WordPress Installation
